### GIS-Tools
# A repository where all of the python tools/workflows I have created can be stored.
All tools can be found within the [tools](https://github.com/wessholders/GIS-Tools/tree/main/Tools) folder of this repo.

# What do I use to make these tools?
- Python
-- NumPy
-- ArcPy
-- ArcGIS API
-- Smartsheet API
- ArcGIS Pro
- ArcPy
- Google Earth Engine
- Smartsheet
## What's the big deal with developing custom tools for use in GIS?
# Automation
I can do all of these proceses manually, why bother with learning python?
# - Speed
- A computer performed process will always be faster than a manually performed task.
- - Think about how many times you back track to check cell size, coordinate system, units, and other details.
# - Accuracy
- Using a computer to perform GIS tasks for you takes all human error out of the equation.
- - Once you get a particular tool dialed in, you know that tool will always perform to the highest accuracy it can.
# - Time Saving
- Any tool that you develop with ArcPy can be ran in the background.
- - You can be doing other important work while your computer is performing tedious tasks.
# - Repetition
- Have you ever been tasked with performing the same exact thing to hundreds or even ***thousands*** of files?
- - Using a simple iterator of loop in python can allow your computer to perform everysingle on of those tasks for you.
