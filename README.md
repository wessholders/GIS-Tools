### GIS-Tools
# A repository where all of the python tools/workflows I have created can be stored.
All tools can be found within the "tools" folder of this repo.

<br>

# What do I use to make these tools?
- Python 3
- Esri's ArcMap Pro
- ArcPy
## What's the big deal with developing custom tools for use in GIS?
# Automation
I can do all of these proceses manually, why bother with learning python?
# - Speed
- A computer performed process will always be faster than a manually performed task.
- - Think about how many times you back track to check cell size, coordinate system, units, and other details.
