## This tool will take an input coastal Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and create projected inundation surfaces based upon specified sea level rise scenarios.

### What kind of DEM works best?
Tidally referenced Coastal DEM's of all coastal counties and territories in the United States have been produced by NOAA. They can be downloaded [here](https://coast.noaa.gov/slrdata/). To download you will want to select the state/territory, find the counties/region of interest (not all are 100% accurate), and click the DEM icon to initiate a download.
